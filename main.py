# Plan for project

# 1. Get goal state
# 2. Generate a random state (part of the 100 random matrices we need to make)
# 3. Check if the puzzle is solvable
# 4. Define the actions that can be done on the matrix
# 5. Measure the first heuristic (h1)
# 6. Measure the second heuristic (h2)
# 7. Measure the third heuristic (h3)
# 8. Implement the A* algorithm (this'll take a while, definitely a big step)
# 9. Keep track of h1, h2 and h3
# 10. Reach goal state and display results
